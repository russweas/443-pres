# Forensics Image Enhancement using Deep Learning

1960’s – bell laboratory
51% of accidents occur in low light / night – need enhancement


Traditional Methods
- Log Transformation
- Thresholding Transformations
- Power-Law Transformation
- Median Filtering: reduces noise
- Gaussian Filtering: ?
- ?

Why Deep Learning?
- Process large ammounts of data

Artificial Neural Networks
- linear algebra - weighted sums

Mean squared error = loss function

Future work directions:
- ResNet, InceptionNet, ?
